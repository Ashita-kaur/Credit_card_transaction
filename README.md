**SQL_Project_Credit_Card_Transaction_Analysis**

This project is a SQL-based analysis of credit card transactions in India. The purpose is to clean, explore, and analyse transaction data to understand spending patterns and trends. Through this project, I demonstrate the use of key SQL concepts such as data cleaning, aggregation, and window functions.

📂 Dataset Description-

The dataset contains information about credit card transactions, including:
•	Transaction date
•	Transaction amount
•	City
•	Card type
•	Expense category
•	Other related details

Project Workflow
1. Data Import
•	Imported the dataset into SQL Server as a table named credit_card_transactions.
•	Renamed all column names to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores to maintain consistency.
•	Assigned correct data types to each column (for example, transaction date as DATE).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Analysed the data to understand spending patterns across cities, card types, and expense categories.
•	Identified trends and key insights using SQL queries.
